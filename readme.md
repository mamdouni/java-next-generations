This is my personal notes about the next generations of Java (from java 8). I will try to cover the most important features of each version and provide some examples.

If you face some difficulties in running the example, try to the adequate java version (if you run an example of java 11 and there are compilation errors, use java 11 as jdk).

Most of the examples are from Sander Mark courses on Pluralsight.
